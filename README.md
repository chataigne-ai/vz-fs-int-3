- There are failing tests by design. Implement the missing methods in the stub file.
- Run tests frequently and use failures as guidance.
- Keep it simple and readable.

Implement the missing methods in:
- `py-exercise/src/python_exercise/exercise.py`

```bash
cd py-exercise
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
pytest
```

## TypeScript

## Candidate instructions
